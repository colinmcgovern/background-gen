# background-gen
Script for generating tilable backgrounds inspired by Earthbound.

I'm going to use these as part of a game or music video. 

The code needs to reorganized for the public to understand, but "g++ background-gen.cpp" to compile and "./a.out" to run.

If enough people want it, I can quickly make a QT GUI to make this a desktop application (EXE)

TODO:
Add the ability for program to use a directory of images instead of just one image.
Add the ability to have images on top of each other 
Put this into a qt project so it is easier for people to use
